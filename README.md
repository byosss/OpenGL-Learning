# OpenGL-Learning

This project is currently designed for educational purposes (for me) to learn graphics programming. It is not intended for production use but rather for learning and personal development.

## Prerequisites

- C++ 64-bit compiler
- CMake (for project build)
- OpenGL Library (version 3.3)
- Operating System: Windows/Linux/macOS

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains source files.
- `include/`: Header files.
- `lib/`: External libraries used by the project.
- `vendor/`: Third-party dependencies or external integrated libraries.
- `assets/`: Project resources (shaders, textures, etc.).
- `build/`: Directory generated during project build.
